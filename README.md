<h1>TO DO LIST</h1>

This is my first HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript project

I'm trying to make a to-do list following a youtube tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ

Also I'm trying to understand the git bash and gitHub integration making this project from scratch in Visual Studio Code.
This first commit will include the three files index.html, style.css and app.js completely empty and rename the master branch to main so it matchs the github notation.

<h2>index.html file</h2>

Every block of code is explained in the html file. The font used in the web app is "Poppins" from google fonts and the icons can be found in fontawesome.com
